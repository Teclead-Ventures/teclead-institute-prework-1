> TODO: PROVIDE REQUIRED ASSETS

## Uber Homepage Clone

It's time to practice our HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

Re-create the Uber homepage as precisely as possible. It doesn't have to be pixel perfect, but try to make it as difficult to tell the difference between your version and the original as you can.

### Getting started

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
- Clone **your forked repo** to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` from within the project directory to install the required dependencies (for this project these are only used to auto-format your work when you make a git commit).
- Complete the project within the (empty) `index.html` and `style.css` files in the `src` directory. Don't edit or worry about any other files in the project.
- When you have finished, commit and push your work to your GitHub repo. Make sure it's public so that we can review it üôè

### Guidelines

- Use plain HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript or styling libraries/CSS frameworks).
- Use the screenshot provided as your example to copy. This way everyone copies the same thing (sites often serve different content based on location etc.).
- Note that you do **not** have to implement the functionality of Uber's homepage.
- Required assets like images and icons are provided in the `src/assets` directory.
- If you want the exact colors, use your browser's DevTools to inspect the real Uber [homepage](https://www.uber.com).
- Uber use their own custom font, so no worries about an exact match. You can stick to `sans-serif` or check out [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to try to find a more similar one.

### Tips & resources

- This isn't so easy. CSS is notoriously fiddly. If you get frustrated, don't worry, we've all been there!

- If you get stuck using a certain feature, practice with a simple example before coming back to the real project.

- Get comfortable with flexbox and grid ‚Äì you'll thank yourself in the long-run. Some helpful resources:

  - [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) are amazing games for learning them in a fun way
  - Jen Simmons' [Layout Lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) (grid guru)

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) might have the best CSS content on the internet. Their [guides](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) are great. Many senior engineers admit they look up [this article](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) whenever they have to center something on a page!

### Bonus / extra credits

Use your browser's DevTools to inspect how the design/layout changes at different screen sizes. Use this as a guide and implement a responsive design for your project.
