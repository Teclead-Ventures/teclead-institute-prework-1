# Teclead Institute Prework – Part 1

## Uber Homepage Clone

It's time to practice our HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

Re-create the Uber homepage as precisely as possible. It doesn't have to be pixel perfect, but try to make it as difficult to tell the difference between your version and the original as you can.

### Guidelines

- Complete the project within the (empty) `index.html` and `style.css` files in the `src` directory.
- Use plain HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript or styling libraries/CSS frameworks).
- Use the screenshot provided as your example to copy. This way everyone copies the same thing (sites often serve different content based on location etc.).
- Required assets like images and icons are provided in the `src/assets` directory.
- If you want the exact colors, use your browser's DevTools to inspect the real Uber [homepage](https://www.uber.com).
- Uber use their own custom font, so no worries about an exact match. You can stick to `sans-serif` or check out [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to try to find a more similar one.

### Tips

- This isn't so easy. CSS is notoriously fiddly. If you get frustrated, don't worry, we've all been there!

- If you get stuck using a certain feature, practice with a simple example before coming back to the real project.

- Get comfortable with flexbox and grid – you'll thank yourself in the long-run. Some helpful resources:

  - [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) are amazing games for learning them in a fun way
  - Jen Simmons' [Layout Lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) (grid guru)
